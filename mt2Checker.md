# Metin2 Accounts Checker 1.0.0

This tool checks for valid Metin2 accounts on the German server [metin2.de](http://de.metin2.gameforge.com). It also checks for characters (only levels, to be changed) and dragon coins. Also, it supports proxy so you can check more than just a few accounts per 5 minutes. It doesn't have multi-threading yet, which is a big disadventage. I'm looking to include it in the future releases tho. For now, it's kinda slow but does it's job. Saves the results to a folder inside programs directory. Accounts that got the captcha verification or accounts that weren't checked due to proxy error or anything else, simply return to the pool.
